## Exercise 1: Working with a while loop
# Printing the game rules
print("Welcome to Guess the Number!")
print("The rules are simple. I will think of a number, and you will try to guess it.")

# Importing random and writing a while loop
import random

totalChances = 5
print("You've {} chances to guess the correct number. Good Luck!".format(totalChances))

# Define Number Guessing Game function
def GuessGame(setGuessRight, setNumber, guessNumber, chance):

        setGuessRight = True
    else:

        print("{} guesses remaining".format(chance))
        setGuessRight = False
    return setGuessRight # Returns True if guess is right

# Run GuessGame() function upto preset chances to play
